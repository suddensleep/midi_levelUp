    "On one extreme, given a single note in the 'current step', it might make sense to store this note's absolute (0-127) value as a key, and to store as its value a dictionary representing a PMF of the possible 'next steps'. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other extreme, if we have three or four notes taken as the 'current step', it might make more sense to 'normalize' the sequence so that it starts at value 0 before storing it as a key. Otherwise, there will likely be very few occurrences of the sequence, leading to quite sparse PMFs as the values and rather large data structures to hold all of the information. Additionally, recentering will help to group together note structures in different musical key signatures that truly represent melodically identical sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a bit of a compromise, we will store 'current steps' with length one or two as **absolute** and with length greater than two as **relative** (i.e. recentered with the first note in the sequence equal to 0)."
