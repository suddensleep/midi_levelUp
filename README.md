# Project Kojak: Augmenting MIDI Files

Training Markov Chain models on melodies and rhythms, and using them to augment existing MIDI files, adding new notes to the files to produce slightly more advanced arrangements.

Work so far:

- [Explaining the formats of the resulting files](./flattening_tracks.ipynb)
