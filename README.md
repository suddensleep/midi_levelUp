# Project Kojak: Augmenting MIDI Files

Training Markov Chain models on melodies and rhythms, and using them to augment existing MIDI files, adding new notes to the files to produce slightly more advanced arrangements.

Work so far:

- [Scraping MIDI files from the internet](./scraper.ipynb) 
- [Explaining the formats of the resulting files](./flattening_tracks.ipynb)
- [Extracting time series information in the rhythmic and melodic domains (first pass)](./getting_melodies_and_rhythms.ipynb)
- [Extracting time series information in the rhythmic and melodic domains (final pass)](./getting_melodies_and_rhythms_optimized.ipynb)
- [Getting markov models up and running](./markov_chains.ipynb)
